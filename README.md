# World-layoff-Data-cleaning-and-EDA
This project focuses on the cleaning and analysis of a dataset that registers global layoffs on the period from March 2020 to March 2023 across multiple countries, companies, and industries. The goal is to perform a general data exploration finding trends, identifying patterns  and provide some insights of market behavior during most of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The code is written in SQL and it is separated into two parts:
1.  Data cleaning: filter irrelevant records, fix values by column, and handle some missing values
2.  Data analysis: find trends by country, company, industry, date, and bankruptcy.

For a detailed visualization of query outputs, a version of this code is hosted on Kaggle and uses SQLite taking advantage of pandas flexibility to read SQL queries, for a complete walkthrough visit the link:
